# NBA DRAFT
### Angular 1.x Code Challenge



This is a simple exercise in which you will create a small app that allows you to select college basketball players and assign them to the NBA teams of your choice.

You will be given a list of the first ten teams that won the lottery for the draft. The list will be in JSON format.

You will also be given a list of the top prospective NBA players that will be the first ten draft picks. This list will also be in JSON format

## Rules
- Your interface should have a drop down for the teams and a dropdown for the players.
- One should be selected from each list and then the "place" button should be pressed which adds the player and his team to a final selection roster.
- After a player is placed on a team, each should be removed from their respective dropdowns.
- When all the players have been placed on teams, a "continue" button should appear that takes you to the page that has the final roster.
- All data should be injected into the controllers through services.

## Extra Credit
- Write a unit test for the services that ensures data is available.
- Replace the css with a preprocessor such as Less or Sass. Use some of its features.
